# Graduate Medical Education Influencers: A National Analysis of Hospital and Policy Drivers

### Research Project Supported by the Georgia Higher Education Healthcare Initiative

## Summary
The Georgia Higher Education Healthcare Initiative supports this research to examine national trends and institutional drivers that influence Graduate Medical Education (GME) outcomes. By identifying structural, financial, and policy-level factors, this project seeks to uncover practical strategies to improve the supply and distribution of physicians and support evidence-based workforce planning.

## Data and Tools
This study utilizes comprehensive **Medicare Hospital Cost Reports**, which provide facility-level data on staffing, costs, utilization, and GME-specific funding. The data is stored in a **relational database structure**, consisting of three linked CSV files containing over **65 million records** across numeric, alpha-numeric, and metadata tables.

Data analysis and modeling are conducted in **R and RStudio**, while **Power BI** is used to develop interactive dashboards for communicating key findings to policymakers, health system leaders, and academic stakeholders.
